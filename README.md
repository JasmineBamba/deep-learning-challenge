Neural Network Model

## What it a is Neural Network?

Neural networks are a powerful machine learning technique modeled after neurons in the brain.
Neural Network is an advanced form of machine learning that contains multiple layers of nodes, which perform individual computations.These computations are connected and weighed against one another until the neurons reach the final layer. In the final layer, the neurons return either a numerical result or an encoded categorical result.

Neural networks can:
- Recognizes patterns and feautures of input data
- Provides a clear quanitative output
